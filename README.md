# Upskilling JSB NodeJS Filtration Task

The sample is an [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) app that uses
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) the [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/)
module for data access and data manipulations, and [Sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/) file based relational database.

And I try to use the REPR (request endpoint response) design pattern for code and folder structure

This is a Simple Task Management App that tries to keep everything as simple as possible so only implements a
* Members - team member that create and assign tasks with (5 curd endpoints)
* Tasks - the tasks information with (5 curd endpoints)

5 curd endpoints mean:
* Get All
* Get One By Id
* Create New Record
* Update Existing Record
* Delete Existing Record

## Setup

1. Clone this repo

## Run
This sample uses an express app running on nodejs.

From the command line run
```
> npm install
> npm start OR npm run dev
```
